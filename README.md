Everything. Humanly. Possible.

# Everything
Thesis

Everything is an idea, is similar in a sense to a metaverse, but not Meta("Facebook")'s version of the metaverse. A true metaverse would be open source, have no singular or granular control by a monopoly or anonymous entity and would be decentralised entirely.

> To go in the idea a bit further, we need to talk about fearEmitters(), you should go to work, but don't go to work, and if you don't go to work then you lose your job.

Decentralization is everywhere, all it basically is > is RGB signals sending binary code to machine code. You can then use that code for machine learning or algorithms. It's really just a display saying where you should plot it.

A truly open-metaverse would be open, no ruling class, node-based, instance based and completely decentralized. Meaning it would not have any governments trying to bio-hack you or anything.

## Block out aptitude testers from picking your brain.

If you've ever heard about aptitude testing or the turing test, you know it means it's a set of conditionals that if the person meets that certain expectation through input devices, you get neural feedback from your devices.

You shouldn't really let anyone into your brain, it's a special explosion made up of neurons and some other atoms in the universe. Never let another entity or brainfucker tell you your secrets to the masses.

# Everything Theory
Everything is the sense that we all live in a bubble and a vacuum, or in a sense, we live in a society of lobbyists, advertisements & cat generators. Futurologists would not like this chaos theory, but I feel like I should kill my dog now.

# everythingOS

In a world where everything is monopolised, we aim to completely decentralize tools and make them available to anyone. Yes, really.

2) Input and output
3) Displays
4) RGB
5) Profit (jk)


# Research Analysis
You can think of a display as like a plot of land, each computer on the network is fighting for that plot of land. Unless you tell that plot of land what to do and where to go, it will have no idea what you're talking about. Computers follow a set of strict instrictions. From the text I'm typing in this README to the RGB signals you see on screen.
